# Traffic Congestion and Accident Prevention Using VANETs

## Overview
This project simulates an intelligent Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) system to reduce traffic congestion and improve road safety using real-time communication and adaptive traffic control techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Java / Python
- SUMO
- NS-3
- HTML, CSS
- MySQL / Oracle SQL

## Features
- Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication
- Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication
- Dynamic Route Guidance
- Adaptive Traffic Signal Control
- Collision Warning System

## How to Run
1. Install SUMO and NS-3
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Run the simulation files
4. Analyze results in the SUMO interface
